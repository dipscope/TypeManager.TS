## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email dipscope@gmail.com instead. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are «yes», then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer «no» to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at dipscope@gmail.com.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of `TypeManager.TS` are you using?
2. What browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?
